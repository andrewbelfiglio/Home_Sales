# Home_Sales

### This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

### This repository contains an .ipynb file which runs in Google CoLab. The file reads in home sales data from an Amazon S3 bucket and uses SparkSQL to run queries on the data to answer various questions about home sales. The use of caching and partitioning demonstrates their utility in improving the time efficiency of queries, which becomes more significant as the size of the dataset increases.

### This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
